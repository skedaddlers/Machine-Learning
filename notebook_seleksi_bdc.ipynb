) , but it's not too bad , really . \\nit's the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo's maiden hollywood effort , hard target ) . \\nin lam's film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians . \\nthese russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn't be noticed ) . \\nthis brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well , \\nyou know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don't have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) . \\nmoreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) . \\nin little odessa , he meets mikhail's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) . \\nthis film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think . \\nafter all , one thing that's been missing from woo's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) . \\nmovies like this shouldn't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too \\\" big \\\" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle . \\nmaximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) . \\nthe emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don't make a hell of a lot of sense ) . \\nin fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv's \\\" kids in the hall \\\" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story . \\nunfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well , \\nyou'll see . \\nthe movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots . \\none is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka . \\nanother , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw . \\nand even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint . \\nof course , the movie does have its share of silliness . \\nfor example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he's getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head . \\nin an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become . \\nbut what has he become ? \\na tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? \\ndoesn't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre . \\nbut let's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly . \\nso maximum risk is a little different from most other action films . \\nwhile watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics . \\nbut watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there's not much left . \\nalthough it's short on spectacle , lam's film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think . \\ni'm more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that's a good sign . \\ngo see maximum risk , but don't expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie . \\nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\ndr t . white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore , but we don't hold this against him . \\n\",\n          \"midway through \\\" anaconda \\\" , documentary filmmaker terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) turns to a co-worker and says \\\" i thought this movie would be my first big break . \\ninstead , it's turned into a disaster . \\\" \\ntruer words have never been spoken . \\n \\\" anaconda \\\" is a monster movie with a lousy monster . \\nit's a suspense film that is utterly predictable . \\nit's a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares , but only in the most elementary way , like a jack-in-the-box . \\nas you turn the crank , you're totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up , but somehow it's still mildly startling when it happens . \\nthe main difference between the giant snake in \\\" anaconda \\\" and the clown in a jack-in-the-box is that the clown is more realistic . \\n \\\" anaconda \\\" boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years . \\nanimatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe- inducing robots you've endured at disney world . \\nbut it's the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame . \\nin one shot , a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall , but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air . \\nthe scene , if done well , would have been a jaw- dropper . \\nhere , the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon . \\nwhat's really amazing is that the filmmaker's were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie . \\nbut enough about the phony snakes . \\nnow it's time to talk about the lousy story . \\nheroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians , a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest . \\nstoltz tells his crew \\\" pray that you didn't forget your bug spray . \\\" \\napparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff , because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect . \\nalong the way , the group rescues a whacked-out lapsed priest ( jon voight ) who claims to know how to find the shirishama . \\nwithin minutes , they throw away all their plans and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness . \\nfrom that point on , the film is a hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from \\\" jaws \\\" and \\\" dead calm . \\\" \\none of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz . \\nearly in the story , his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious . \\nso why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance ? \\nalso , why did stoltz , who generally selects his roles with great care , agree to appear in this crap ? \\nah , the mysteries of hollywood . \\nthe remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen . \\njonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary , but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters . \\nlopez , who starred in \\\" selena , \\\" is an enormously appealing performer , possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible . \\nice cube has a special charisma ; an ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously . \\nthere's also a special twinkle in his eyes , as if he's gently mocking his own tough-guy posturing . \\nbut the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight . \\nobsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas , voight plays the villain in thick accent , with a series of leers and hisses , spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of \\\" jonny quest . \\\" \\nat one point , he looms over the crew and says \\\" the anaconda is the perfect killing machine . \\nit strikes , wraps around you , holds you tighter than your true love . \\nand you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode . \\n \\\" that moment is so high-camp that it almost made the film tolerable . \\nalmost . \\nfans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out \\\" anaconda . \\\" \\ndon't . \\nthere are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer , including another \\\" alien \\\" sequel . \\nwait for them , rent \\\" jaws \\\" in the meantime , and don't throw away your money and time on drivel like this . \\n\",\n          \"i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . \\nthis was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . \\nnot only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . \\nthe very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . \\ngibson's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . \\ngibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better . \\nthe character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . \\ntry to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups . \\nif you can imagine that , then you've basically got jerry fletcher . \\nin many ways , i was surprised by this movie . \\nto begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . \\ndon't get me wrong , it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie . \\nsecondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance . \\nhe provided a fantastic performance . \\nthe previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . \\ngibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . \\nfor instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . \\nand last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . \\nwriter brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions . \\nmel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film . \\njulia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . \\nhe also seems obsessed and in love with her . \\nbut whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . \\njerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . \\nalthough he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . \\nvery soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . \\nafter barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . \\nthe remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy . \\nand more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life . \\nmany things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . \\nfor instance , the meaning of the book \\\" the catcher in the rye \\\" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . \\nlee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . \\nmake sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . \\ndefinitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it . \\ni am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . \\nand even if you aren't , you should still like this film . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
